## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL     
}
get <- function() x
setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
getInverse <- function() i
list(set = set, get = get,
     setInverse = setInverse,
     getInverse = getInverse)
       
}
        

##This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
       ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
       i <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        mat <- x$get()
        i <- solve(mat, ...)
        x$setInverse(i)
        i
}
